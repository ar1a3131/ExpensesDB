To enter nas in cmd: 
ssh helpdesk@10.100.10.58 -p 5064

Access the PostgreSQL container from cmd: sudo docker exec -it postgres-1 /bin/bash

To enter database from PostgreSQL container: psql -U postgres -d expensesdb



Source code for the full stack code is in Helpdesk@F1-NAS2/volume1/ExpensesDB... I edited files using vim, if needed

running the backend in NAS2/volume1/ExpensesDB/backend: node server.js


ip address of PostgreSQL container: 172.17.0.2 -> only 10.100.10.58 worked

to view data in json form: 
http://10.100.10.58:5002/api/rows

make sure to run backend with node server.js

start and stop frontend:
sudo docker stop react-frontend
sudo docker start react-frontend


To see all containers on the nas that are active:
sudo docker ps



REFRESHING REACT CODE:
-npm run build

-firstly, stop the container:
sudo docker stop react-frontend

-remove currently running container to avoid conflicts:
sudo docker rm react-frontend

-rebuild react code:
sudo docker build -t my-react-app .

-run the docker container:
sudo docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app

-testing that backend is working:
curl http://10.100.10.58:5002/api/rows
^ make sure you run node server.js in another window

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE HARDCODED IN FILE BY NAME .env IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE PORT NUMBERS/IP ADDRESSES/DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD

^same commands should apply to the backend container, just instead of "react-frontend", use "expensesdb-backend"
