1. Helpdesk@F1-NAS2:/volume1/ExpensesDB$  sudo netstat -tuln | grep 5432
Password:
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5432          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

^need to get rid of that listening port^

2. have reliable data backup besides the PostgreSQL volume in the NAS (explained in data_recovery.txt and backup.txt)

3. allow option in submit request to add request to inventory:
	1. add request to inventory checkbox
	2. (if checked) new item type? -> if no then give a dropdown of all existing items -> select an item -> add a specific amount to the existing inventory or take away amount
	3. if yes for new item type, allow the user to type in the new item type and have it be added to the dropdown for the future

4. add to inventory page, make it easy to update
